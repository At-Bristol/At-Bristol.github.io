The documentation for our Data Dome Unity Toolkit is here:

The Data Dome Unity Toolkit is a prefab for Unity which allows you to really easily make your Unity project for domes or planetarium screens. It achieves the dome distortion quickly and efficiently and minimises the problems of aliasing and visible seams which can associated with dome distortion methods. 

The documentation is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_5SlMKap8CyS1FGaEQ3aUdCX2c/view?usp=sharing)

Its open source, free to use for commercial projects too in any dome. Enjoy - and do let us know if you use it for any projects outside of the Bristol Dome.
