We have wanted to do a test streaming data into the dome for a while but there are relatively few data sources around that update rapidly enough to warrant realtime streaming, so we thought weâ€™d try an audio visualisation. This also served as a bit of test of latency between the console and the dome and because we want to do more music in the dome and having it react would be extremely cool.

This is done in html5 because, frankly, its easy - but actually,  using a browser window stretched across the dome is a very effective way to develop a visualisation particularly from a web source. 

At the moment this is rendering on a 2d canvas element, but in the future were going to use web GL
Theres a live demo [here](https://plt-domeaudioviz.firebaseapp.com/)

Only works in Chrome at the moment, and requires microphone access.
