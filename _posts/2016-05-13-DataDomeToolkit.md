We are pleased to say our unity plugin for our dome is [here](https://github.com/At-Bristol/Data-Dome-Unity-Toolkit)!

The catchily named Data Dome Unity Toolkit is a prefab for the [Unity](http://unity3d.com) game engine which allows drag and drop conversion of any unity build to dome format. It provides option to control field of view, forward tilt and anti aliasing settings which we have found give the best result on our dome.

Its currently going through the approval process for the Unity asset store, but it is available immediately from our [Github](https://github.com/At-Bristol/Data-Dome-Unity-Toolkit).
