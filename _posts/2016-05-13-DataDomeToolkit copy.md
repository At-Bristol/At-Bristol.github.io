One of the questions we get from developers is how to get access to the dome to try out content.

At the moment we allow developers who are interested and have produced their own content to come in and have a look at it on the dome for no cost.

We squeeze these preview sessions in the little bit of downtime the planetarium has before public shows start. That time is every weekday morning between 9:00 and 10:30.

Sessions need to be booked generally about a week in advance as that time is shared with maintenance and internal training which take priority.

These preview session are offered entirely at our discretion and depend on staff availability. 

To book a preview session or to ask any questions email: seamus.foley@at-bristol.org.uk or call 077 6880 6677 between 9 and 5.
