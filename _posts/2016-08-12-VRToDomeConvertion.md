In an effort to make it easier to get 360 videos onto the dome we have come up with a tool to convert videos and stills from the ‘normal’ 360 equirectangular projection to the azimuthal equidistant projection required by the dome. It does this on the fly on the GPU so no rendering is required. You can download the mac and windows builds [here](https://github.com/At-Bristol/VR-to-Dome-Converter/releases/tag/0.1.0-alpha)

At the moment this tool will allow you to set up the shot how you like, and preview how your 360 content will look on the dome.
